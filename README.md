# Show the newest items in list
My first "production code" I used back in 2018 when I was working as a CRM Administrator. The manual work was to find if there are new products in the excel spreadsheet that came updated with new prices every 2 weeks. Besides prices, the vendor also put the new product IDs there so that way we were finding out if there are new products we don't know about. There was a separate PHP tool that scrapes those products but that's another topic. So that was my first automation I did which saved me a lot of time. Looking back on it now in April 2024, there are much better ways to automate this, but with time and experience you become more efficient.
