# List-Comparer
My first java desktop app I made a long time ago. I created this to help myself at work, the program simply compares 2 lists - 1 categorized as old and 1 categorized as new. The program goes through both lists and compares them, checks if there are missing values from the old list in the new list and displays them. Working with tables at work and having to compare 2 price lists for missing products was though for me, so I made this small tool to help other people. Enjoy.
